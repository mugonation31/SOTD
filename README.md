## ðŸš¨ Development Rules

### Test Stability Rule
**NEVER make changes to tests once they are written and passing.** Tests serve as a contract for expected behavior. If functionality needs to change, update the implementation to match the existing test expectations, not the other way around. This ensures:
- Consistent behavior across the application
- Reliable regression testing
- Clear documentation of expected functionality
- Stable development workflow

### Password Reset Implementation Details
The reset password functionality includes:
- **Token Extraction:** Multi-source token retrieval (URL hash fragment, localStorage, sessionStorage)
- **Direct API Integration:** Uses fetch API directly to Supabase Auth endpoints for reliability
- **Comprehensive Testing:** 42 tests covering unit, integration, and service scenarios
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Security:** Proper token cleanup and session management
